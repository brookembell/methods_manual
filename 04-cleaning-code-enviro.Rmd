# Cleaning Code for Environment Data

This chapter walks you through all of the R code used to clean the raw **ENVIRONMENT**-related data inputs. The resulting cleaned dataset is then used to calculate the environment impact factors (see **Chapter XXX**).

## Clean and Restructure Intermediary Datasets

This script imports all of raw cost-related data inputs, and then cleans and merges them so that the cost impact factors can later be calculated.

Note that you must first open the 'methods_manual' R project before running this script or else it will not work.

First, let's set up our environment.

```{r}

# check working directory
getwd()

# SET UP -----

rm(list = ls())

options(scipen=999)

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(survey)

my_date <- Sys.Date()

```

### Import and Merge Data Inputs

#### NHANES Diet Intake {-}

**The following code is the same code used in Section XXX**.

First, read in the NHANES food-level datasets. The data were split into "day 1" and "day 2" earlier, and here we are going to merge them into "both days". There also are different datasets containing just sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) data, so we have to import those in separately, and then merge with the rest of the day1/day2 diet datasets.

Import all of the "day 1" datasets first. 

```{r}

# import
day1 <- read_rds("data_inputs/DIET/dietary_intake/DATA/clean_data/foods_day1_clean.rds")

# only select needed variables
day1_sub <- day1 %>% select(SEQN, DRDINT, DR1DRSTZ, DR1ILINE, DR1IFDCD, 
                            DR1IGRMS, DESCRIPTION, foodsource, nhanes_cycle, dayrec, added_sugar) %>% 
  rename(seqn = SEQN,
         line = DR1ILINE,
         foodcode = DR1IFDCD,
         grams = DR1IGRMS,
         description = DESCRIPTION,
         daysintake = DRDINT,
         reliable = DR1DRSTZ)

# ssb
ssb_1 <- read_rds("data_inputs/DIET/dietary_intake/DATA/clean_data/foods_day1_ssb.rds")

# merge food and ssb
day1_sub1 <- left_join(day1_sub, ssb_1, by = c("seqn" = "SEQN",
                                               "line" = "DR1ILINE",
                                               "foodcode" = "DR1IFDCD",
                                               "description" = "DESCRIPTION",
                                               "grams" = "DR1IGRMS"))

```

Then import all of "day 2" datasets.

```{r}

# import
day2 <- read_rds("data_inputs/DIET/dietary_intake/DATA/clean_data/foods_day2_clean.rds")

# only select needed variables
day2_sub <- day2 %>% select(SEQN, DRDINT, DR2DRSTZ, DR2ILINE, DR2IFDCD, 
                            DR2IGRMS, DESCRIPTION, foodsource, nhanes_cycle, dayrec, added_sugar) %>% 
  rename(seqn = SEQN,
         line = DR2ILINE,
         foodcode = DR2IFDCD,
         grams = DR2IGRMS,
         description = DESCRIPTION,
         daysintake = DRDINT,
         reliable = DR2DRSTZ)

# ssb
ssb_2 <- read_rds("data_inputs/DIET/dietary_intake/DATA/clean_data/foods_day2_ssb.rds")

# merge food and ssb
day2_sub1 <- left_join(day2_sub, ssb_2, by = c("seqn" = "SEQN",
                                               "line" = "DR2ILINE",
                                               "foodcode" = "DR2IFDCD",
                                               "description" = "DESCRIPTION",
                                               "grams" = "DR2IGRMS"))
```

Then, combine the "day 1" and "day 2" datasets to get a "both_days" dataset.

```{r}

both_days <- rbind(day1_sub1, day2_sub1) %>% arrange(seqn, dayrec, line)

# check to make sure the formatting worked
both_days %>% filter(description == "Meat, NFS") %>% View() #looks good!

```

Lastly, remove the original diet datasets becuase they are very large and we don't need them anymore.

```{r}

rm(list=setdiff(ls(), c("both_days", "my_date")))

```

#### Mapping from Dietary Factor to FNDDS Food Code {-}

This mapping is needed to handle some data processing in later code chunks.

First, create an empty dataset template that contains all of the foodcodes that exist in the diet dataset (both_days).

```{r}

all_foodcodes <- both_days %>% select(foodcode) %>% distinct()

```

Then, import the non-grain food mapping (labeled as "map_a").

```{r}

map_a <- read_csv("data_inputs/OTHER/dietfactor_to_fndds_mapping/DATA/Food_to_FNDDS_mapping_detailed_04-06-25.csv")

```

Then, join the template and the first mapping.

```{r}

my_join <- full_join(mutate(all_foodcodes, i=1), 
                     mutate(map_a, i=1)) %>% 
  select(-i) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(foodcode, paste0("^", foodcode_prefix))) %>% 
  select(-foodcode_prefix)

```

Import the grain-only mapping (labeled as "map_b").

```{r}

map_b <- read_csv("data_inputs/OTHER/dietfactor_to_fndds_mapping/DATA/Food_to_FNDDS_mapping_WHOLE_GRAINS_ONLY_09-05-23.csv")

```

Merge my_join with the second mapping.

```{r}

my_join1 <- rbind(my_join, map_b) %>% arrange(foodcode)

```

Lastly, merge back with both_days.

```{r}

both_days1 <- left_join(both_days, my_join1, by = "foodcode")

```

Check how many FNDDS codes in the dataset don't have a mapping to a dietary factor (i.e., food group category)

```{r}

both_days1 %>% 
  filter(is.na(Foodgroup)) %>% 
  select(foodcode, description) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(foodcode)

```

Check SSB by comparing the "ssb" indicator variable and the data when the foodgroup is set to "ssb".

```{r}

both_days1 %>% filter(ssb == 1) %>% View()
both_days1 %>% filter(ssb == 1 & Foodgroup == "ssb") %>% View()
both_days1 %>% filter(ssb == 1 & Foodgroup != "ssb") %>% View() # need to change these to ssb
both_days1 %>% filter(ssb == 0 & Foodgroup == "ssb") %>% View() # need to change these to other
both_days1 %>% filter(ssb == 0 & Foodgroup != "ssb") %>% View()

```

We see that, for some of the rows, ssb is labeled incorrectly, so we need to fix it.

```{r}

both_days2 <- both_days1 %>% 
  mutate(Foodgroup = ifelse(ssb == 1 & Foodgroup != "ssb", "ssb", Foodgroup)) %>% 
  mutate(Foodgroup = ifelse(ssb == 0 & Foodgroup == "ssb", "other", Foodgroup))

```

Check again. Looks good.

```{r}

both_days2 %>% filter(ssb == 1 & Foodgroup == "ssb") %>% View()
both_days2 %>% filter(ssb == 1 & Foodgroup != "ssb") %>% View() # none-good
both_days2 %>% filter(ssb == 0 & Foodgroup == "ssb") %>% View() # none-good
both_days2 %>% filter(ssb == 0 & Foodgroup != "ssb") %>% View()

```

Rename variable.

```{r}

both_days3 <- both_days2 %>% 
  rename(Foodgroup_FNDDS = Foodgroup)

```

Tidy up the global environment and only keep the datasets we currently need.

```{r}

rm(list=setdiff(ls(), c("both_days3", "my_date")))

```


This dataset containing the FNDDS foodcodes that represent seafood dishes will then be used in the following code chunk.

#### Mapping from FNDDS Food Code to FCID Code {-}

Import the mapping and join with the both_days dataset.

```{r}

# import 
map <- read_csv("data_inputs/OTHER/fndds_to_fcid_mapping/DATA/FCID_0118_LASTING.csv")

map1 <- map %>% select(foodcode, fcidcode, fcid_desc, wt)

# combine with food data
both_days4 <- full_join(both_days3, map1, by = "foodcode")

# if SEQN (subject ID) is missing, remove from dataset
both_days5 <- both_days4 %>% 
  filter(!(is.na(seqn))) %>% 
  arrange(seqn, dayrec, line) %>% 
  relocate(c(foodsource, nhanes_cycle, dayrec), .after = last_col())

# look at ssb
both_days5 %>% filter(ssb == 1) %>% View()
both_days5 %>% filter(ssb==1) %>% select(fcid_desc) %>% table()

```

#### Food Loss and Waste Data {-}

Import the food loss & waste coefficients and join with the both_days dataset.

```{r}

# import losswaste data
# losswaste <- read_csv("data_inputs/OTHER/food_waste/DATA/losswaste.csv")

# import the proxy data for missing loss/waste data
losswaste_complete <- read_csv("data_inputs/OTHER/food_waste/DATA/missing_data/resolved/Missing waste coefficients (full)_090523.csv") %>% 
  select(-c(fcid_desc, Foodgroup, Proxy, Notes))

# merge with bothdays
both_days6 <- left_join(both_days5, losswaste_complete, by = "fcidcode")

```

#### Mapping From FCID Food Code to Dietary Factor {-}

First, we import the original mapping.

```{r}

# import fcid-diet factor mapping
new_map <- read_xlsx("data_inputs/OTHER/dietfactor_to_fcid_mapping/DATA/FCID_to_dietaryfactor_mapping_01-09-2024_final.xlsx") %>% 
  select(FCID_Code, Foodgroup) %>% 
  rename(fcidcode = FCID_Code,
         Foodgroup_FCID = Foodgroup)

# merge
both_days7 <- left_join(both_days6, new_map, by = "fcidcode")

# which FNDDS foodcodes have missing FCID food group?
both_days7 %>% filter(is.na(Foodgroup_FCID)) %>% View()
both_days7 %>% filter(is.na(Foodgroup_FCID)) %>% select(foodcode, description) %>% distinct()

```

But, we can see that there's some missing so our team went and manually updated the mapping, which is imported in the following code chunk.

```{r}

# import updated mapping
fcids_new <- read_csv("data_inputs/OTHER/dietfactor_to_fcid_mapping/DATA/missing_data/resolved/Missing FCIDS_mapped.csv") %>% 
  select(-description) %>% 
  rename(Foodgroup_FCID = Foodgroup)

# row patch new mapping with both days
both_days8 <- rows_patch(both_days7, fcids_new, unmatched = "ignore")

# which ones have missing fcid?
both_days8 %>% filter(is.na(fcidcode)) %>% View()
both_days8 %>% filter(is.na(fcidcode)) %>% select(foodcode, description, fcidcode) %>% distinct() %>% View()

```
There are now fewer missing coefficients, but still some. In some of these cases, the FNDDS foodcode can represent the FCID code (i.e., single ingredient foods). Below, I manually add these waste coefficents for dasheen and corn.

```{r}

# dasheen
dash <- losswaste_complete %>% filter(fcidcode == "103139000") %>% 
  #change the fcidcode
  mutate(foodcode = 71962020,
         wt = 100)

# corn
corn <- losswaste_complete %>% filter(fcidcode == "1500127000") %>% 
  #change the fcidcode
  mutate(foodcode = 75215990, 
         wt = 100)

# combine
comb <- rbind(dash, corn) %>% select(-fcidcode)

# row patch with bothdays
both_days9 <- rows_patch(both_days8, comb, by = "foodcode")

# check missing fcid
both_days9 %>% filter(is.na(fcidcode)) %>% View()

# check missing waste coef
both_days9 %>% filter(is.na(waste_coef)) %>% View()

```

There's still a few FCID codes that don't have waste and inedible coefficients, but it's not very many, so we will leave for now.

Calculate the FCID-level consumed, inedible, and wasted amounts of food.

```{r}

both_days10 <- both_days9 %>% 
  mutate(consumed_amt_FCID = grams * (wt / 100),
         inedible_amt_FCID = consumed_amt_FCID * ined_coef,
         wasted_amt_FCID = consumed_amt_FCID * waste_coef)

```

Calculate the FNDDS-level consumed, inedible, and wasted amounts of food. This isn't needed for the environmental impact factors, but it is needed for the cost impact factors in the next section.

```{r}

both_days11 <-
  both_days10 %>% 
  group_by(seqn, dayrec, line, foodcode) %>% 
  mutate(consumed_amt_FNDDS = grams,
         inedible_amt_FNDDS = sum(inedible_amt_FCID, na.rm = TRUE),
         wasted_amt_FNDDS = sum(wasted_amt_FCID, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup()

# get distinct dataset
fndds_flw <- both_days11 %>% 
  select(seqn, dayrec, line, foodcode, description, consumed_amt_FNDDS, 
         inedible_amt_FNDDS, wasted_amt_FNDDS) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(seqn, dayrec, line)

# export to use in next section
saveRDS(fndds_flw, "data_inputs/IMPACT_FACTORS/temp_data/fndds_flw.rds")

```

Tidy up the global environment.

```{r}

rm(list=setdiff(ls(), c("both_days11", "my_date")))

```

#### FCID-Level Environmental Impact Factors (dataField) {-}

There are two environmental datasets that need to be imported. The first dataset contains greenhouse gas (GHG) and cummulative energy demand (CED) impact factors. The second contains water scarcity (WATER) and bluewater use (BLUEWATER) impact factors.

```{r}

# import datafield (non-water)
datafield <- read_xlsx("data_inputs/ENVIRONMENT/ghg_ced_impacts/DATA/dataFIELDv1.0_LASTING_120723.xlsx",
                sheet = "FCID linkages",
                skip = 2)

datafield_sub <- datafield %>% 
  select(FCID_Code, `MJ / kg`, `CO2 eq / kg`) %>% 
  rename(GHG_mn = `CO2 eq / kg`,
         CED_mn = `MJ / kg`,
         fcidcode = FCID_Code) %>% 
  mutate(fcidcode = as.character(fcidcode))

# import datafield (water impacts)
datafield_water <- read_xlsx("data_inputs/ENVIRONMENT/water_impacts/DATA/dataFIELD_water public v1_LASTING_120723.xlsx",
                             sheet = "FCID Codes",
                             skip = 2)

datafield_water_sub <- datafield_water %>% 
  select(FCID_Code, `liter eq. / kg`, `L /kg`) %>% 
  rename(WATER_mn = `liter eq. / kg`,
         BLUEWATER_mn = `L /kg`,
         fcidcode = FCID_Code) %>% 
  mutate(fcidcode = as.character(fcidcode))

# merge the two datafield datasets together
datafield_comb <- left_join(datafield_sub, datafield_water_sub, by = "fcidcode")

# now merge with bothdays
both_days12 <- both_days11 %>% 
  mutate(fcidcode = as.character(fcidcode)) %>% 
  left_join(datafield_comb, by = "fcidcode")

```

Below, we check the dataset for missing impact factors.

```{r}

both_days12 %>% filter(is.na(GHG_mn)) %>% View()
both_days12 %>% filter(is.na(GHG_mn) & ssb == 1) %>% View()
both_days12 %>% filter(is.na(GHG_mn) & Foodgroup_FNDDS == "ssb") %>% View()
both_days12 %>% filter(is.na(GHG_mn) & Foodgroup_FNDDS == "ssb") %>% 
  select(description, Foodgroup_FNDDS) %>% distinct() %>% View() # these are all diet drinks and not ssb

both_days12 %>% filter(is.na(GHG_mn)) %>% select(Foodgroup_FNDDS) %>% table()
both_days12 %>% filter(is.na(GHG_mn)) %>% select(Foodgroup_FCID) %>% table()
```

Our team manually assigned proxies for some of these FCID codes with missing environmental impact factors. 

```{r}

# import proxies for missing enviro data
ghg_proxies <- read_csv("data_inputs/ENVIRONMENT/ghg_ced_impacts/DATA/missing_data/resolved/Missing environmental impacts_mapped.csv")

ghg_proxies_sub <- ghg_proxies %>% 
  select(foodcode, description, proxy_fcidcode, proxy_desc) %>% 
  rename(fcidcode = proxy_fcidcode,
         fcid_desc = proxy_desc) %>% 
  mutate(fcidcode = as.character(fcidcode))

# update rows with proxies
both_days13 <- rows_update(both_days12, ghg_proxies_sub, by = c("foodcode", "description"))

# check corn
both_days13 %>% filter(foodcode == 75215990) %>% View() # good

# fcid should be herb
both_days13 %>% filter(foodcode == 72133200) %>% View() # good!

# insert enviro data for fcids that were originally missing
both_days14 <- both_days13 %>% 
  rows_patch(datafield_comb, by = "fcidcode", unmatched = "ignore") %>% 
  ungroup()

# check corn
both_days14 %>% filter(foodcode == 75215990) %>% View()

# confirm there are no more missing FCIDs
both_days14 %>% filter(is.na(fcidcode)) %>% View() # good

# confirm there are no more missing GHG
both_days14 %>% filter(is.na(GHG_mn)) %>% View() 
both_days14 %>% filter(is.na(GHG_mn)) %>% select(description, Foodgroup_FCID) %>% distinct() %>% View()
both_days14 %>% filter(is.na(GHG_mn)) %>% select(Foodgroup_FCID) %>% distinct()
both_days14 %>% filter(is.na(WATER_mn)) %>% select(Foodgroup_FCID) %>% distinct()

```

At this point, most of the missing is for babyfood and other foods, so we will move on.

Tidy up the global environment.

```{r}

rm(list=setdiff(ls(), c("both_days14", "my_date")))

```

#### FCID-Level Social Impact Factors (i.e., Forced Labor Risk) {-}

Import the forced labor (FL) risk scores (excluding seafood for now) and join with both_days.

```{r}

# import fl scores
fl <- read_csv("data_inputs/SOCIAL/forced_labor/DATA/FL_scores_FCID_062124.csv") %>% 
  select(FCID_Code_chr, Weight_Conversion, FL_Score_Value_grams) %>% 
  mutate(FCID_Code_chr = as.character(FCID_Code_chr))

# now merge
both_days15 <- left_join(both_days14, fl, by = c("fcidcode" = "FCID_Code_chr"))

# any missing fl scores?
both_days15 %>% filter(is.na(FL_Score_Value_grams)) %>% View() #fine
both_days15 %>% filter(is.na(FL_Score_Value_grams)) %>% select(Foodgroup_FCID) %>% distinct() #fine

```

Now we have to handle the seafood scores. First, look at the rows where either the FNDDS- or FCID-level food group is seafood.

```{r}

both_days15 %>% filter(Foodgroup_FNDDS == "pf_seafood") %>% View()
both_days15 %>% filter(Foodgroup_FCID == "pf_seafood") %>% View()
both_days15 %>% filter(Foodgroup_FNDDS == "pf_seafood" & Foodgroup_FCID == "pf_seafood") %>% View()

```

Split both_days into two distinct datasets so that we can work with them separately: one containing all rows where both the FNDDS- and FCID-level food group is seafood, and the second containing the remaining rows.

```{r}

seafood <- both_days15 %>% filter(Foodgroup_FNDDS == "pf_seafood" & Foodgroup_FCID == "pf_seafood") %>% 
  select(-c(Weight_Conversion, FL_Score_Value_grams))

no_seafood <- both_days15 %>% filter(!(Foodgroup_FNDDS == "pf_seafood" & Foodgroup_FCID == "pf_seafood"))

# check
nrow(seafood) + nrow(no_seafood)
nrow(both_days15)
nrow(seafood) + nrow(no_seafood) == nrow(both_days15)

```
