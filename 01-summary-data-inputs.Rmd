# Summary of Data Inputs

## Overview

This chapter describes all of the data inputs that are used in the model. All data inputs fall into one of the following categories: diet, health, environment, economic, social, and other.

## Diet Inputs

### Counterfactual Intake

#### Purpose {-}

This dataset contains three recommended dietary patterns (Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern, Healthy Vegetarian Dietary Pattern, and Healthy Mediterranean-Style Dietary Pattern) from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) 2020-2025 report; 1 vegan dietary pattern published in the literature, and 1 dietary pattern that was constructed by the LASTING team (DGA+ Pattern). This dataset serves as the “ideal” dietary pattern that we are shifting to in the 4 models.

#### Data pre-processing notes {-}

We use the 2,000-calorie recommendations for all dietary patterns.

Standard deviations were calculated as 10% of the recommendation value, and standard errors were set to 0.

Any recommendation values at the week-level were converted to day-level. For example, the Healthy U.S.-Style recommends 1.5 cups/week of dark-green vegetables. This value was divided by 7 and the new value is 0.21 cups/day.

Some of the DGA recommendations for various food items were grouped together. For example, the Healthy U.S.-Style recommends 26 oz/week of meats, poultry, and eggs, but it does not provide values for just meats, poultry, or eggs. Therefore, to get recommendation values for each of these three food items individually, we used NHANES 2015-2018 data to look at the intake distribution of these three food items and then applied that proportion to the total 26 oz/week value. This same method was applied to the food group ‘Nuts, seeds, and soy products’, and ‘Limit on calories for other uses’ (added sugar and saturated fat).

We also had to construct recommendation values for the dietary factors ‘fruit_exc_juice’ (fruit excluding juice) and ‘veg_exc_sta’ (vegetables excluding starchy vegetables).

The recommendation value for veg_exc_sta was simply the sum of the recommendation values for veg_dg (dark-green vegetables), veg_ro (red-orange vegetables), and veg_oth (other vegetables).

To calculate the recommendation value for fruit_exc_juice, we utilized the proportion of whole fruits to fruit juice from NHANES. Approximately 75% of total fruit consumed was whole fruit excluding juice. Therefore, the recommendation value for fruit_exc_juice was the DGA recommended value for total fruit multiplied by 0.753.

The NHANES proportions are located in:

- methods_manual/data_inputs/DIET/counterfactual_intake/DATA/NHANES proportions.xlsx (sheets ‘Fruit proportions’, ‘Veg proportions’, ‘Animal protein props US MED’, ‘Veg protein proportions US MED’, and ‘Sugar proportions’)

### Cancer Incidence

#### Purpose {-}

This dataset contains U.S. disease-specific cancer incidence rates from 2018, by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.

The following cancers were included in the analysis:

- Colon and rectum (CC)
- Corpus uteri (UC)
- Esophagus: adenomas and adenocarcinomas (ECA) (Note: this is a subset of esophagus cancer)
- Female breast (post-menopause) (BC)*
- Gallbladder (GC)
- Kidney and renal pelvis (KC)
- Liver and intrahepatic bile duct (LVC)
- Lung and bronchus (LC)
- Meningiomas: meningiomas (MC)
- Myeloma: Multiple myeloma/plasma-cell leukemia (MMC)
- Mouth, larynx, and pharynx cancers (MLPC)
- Ovary (OC)
- Pancreas (PC)
- Prostate (advanced) (APCA) (Note: this is a subset of prostate cancer)
- Stomach cardia (SCC)
- Stomach non-cardia (SCNC)
- Thyroid (TC)

*We only included breast cancer cases from women who were diagnosed at ages 51 years or older to estimate the number of post-menopausal breast cancer cases.

#### Raw Data Processing Notes {-}

The following SAS codes were used to transform the raw .txt files into SAS datasets:

- methods_manual/data_inputs/HEALTH/cancer_incidence/CODE/cancerrate_wide2018_0213.sas
- methods_manual/data_inputs/HEALTH/cancer_incidence/CODE/esophagus2018_0213.sas
- methods_manual/data_inputs/HEALTH/cancer_incidence/CODE/multiplemyeloma2018_0213.sas
- methods_manual/data_inputs/HEALTH/cancer_incidence/CODE/prostate2018_0213.sas
- methods_manual/data_inputs/HEALTH/cancer_incidence/CODE/stomach2018_0213.sas
- methods_manual/data_inputs/HEALTH/cancer_incidence/CODE/postmenopausal2018_1115.sas

The resulting SAS dataset files are located here:

- methods_manual/data_inputs/HEALTH/cancer_incidence/DATA/raw_data/cancerrate2018.sas7bdat
- methods_manual/data_inputs/HEALTH/cancer_incidence/DATA/raw_data/cancer.sas7bdat
- methods_manual/data_inputs/HEALTH/cancer_incidence/DATA/raw_data/esophagus.sas7bdat

- methods_manual/data_inputs/HEALTH/cancer_incidence/DATA/raw_data/stomach.sas7bdat
- methods_manual/data_inputs/HEALTH/cancer_incidence/DATA/raw_data/postbreast.sas7bdat

Then, the following two SAS codes were used to calculate the estimated number of cancer cases per demographic subgroup in 2018:

- data_final/in/HEALTH PILLAR/Cancer incidence/Cancerrate2018CRUDE_1115.sas
- data_final/in/HEALTH PILLAR/Cancer incidence/cancerNHANES 1718POP_0212.sas (generates subgroup population number from NHANES)

First, the crude rate for each cancer for each demographic subgroup is calculated by dividing the number of cancer cases reported by the sample population size:

$$ Crude rate = count of cancer cases / sample population size $$

Then, this rate is applied to the 2018 subgroup population numbers (from the US Census Bureau—described in previous section):

$$ No. of cases = crude rate * population size $$

The number of post-menopausal breast cancer cases was calculated slightly differently than the others because we only wanted to estimate breast cancer cases from women who were diagnosed at ages 51 years or older. Specifically, for the demographic subgroups that were female and aged 45-54 (subgroups 17, 18, 19, 20), we applied the crude rate to the U.S. population size of those aged 51-54 (rather than aged 45-54).

#### Cleaning Code Location {-}

The cleaning codes for this data input are located in Chapter 3.1.2 - Health Data Inputs [link] and Chapter 3.2.1 (1) Cancer incidence and (2) CVD mortality [link].

#### Data Cleaning Notes {-}

The standard error of the cancer counts is calculated as:

$$count_se = (crude_se / 100000) * population)$$

Also, the cancer and CMD datasets are merged into one combined "disease" dataset.
