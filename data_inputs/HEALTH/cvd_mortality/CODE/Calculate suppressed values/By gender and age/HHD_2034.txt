Caveats:
"1. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"

"2. The method used to calculate 95% confidence intervals is documented here: More information:"
