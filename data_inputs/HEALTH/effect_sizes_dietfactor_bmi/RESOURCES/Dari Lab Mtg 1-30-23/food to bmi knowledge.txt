bmi for diabetes - 10 dieteary factos with bmi - meghan's paper

stratified by normal vs overweight, no data on obese assume same s overweight

no children in our analyses. 

have not updated those results - 

change in change - not biased - no new cohorts that have this data

not many cohorts that do this

biased if look at baseline diet 

absolute effects are not generalizable, 3 different cohorts - 

not consistent with relative, absolute effect were consistent ok (surprising)


no age effect, 

-more foods, there is a manuscript with more foods

- seafood poutlry, eggs (data in bmi units)
